    // New questions from Haramaya University Model Exam
    {
        "question": "In a function declaration, it is possible to use default argument, in which default value is a value to be used if no one is supplied from the function caller. Accordingly, which one of the following is the correct way of setting default values for a function named as myFunction which has three parameters named as x, y and z of integer data type?",
        "code": `// Which declaration is correct?
// A. long myFunction (int x=50, int y, int z);
// B. long myFunction (int x, int y, int z=150);
// C. long myFunction (int x=50, int y=100, int z);`,

        "options": [
            "A. Once the type has been defined through the C++ 'struct' keyword, you can create variables from it just like you would any other type.",
            "B. After creating a structure variable you must create a structure definition.",
            "C. The structure definition is a listing of all member variables with their types and names.",
            "D. Defining a structure is giving the compiler a blueprint for creating your type.",
            "E. None of the Above"
        ],
        "answer": 1,
        "explanation": "Option B is incorrect. The structure must be defined BEFORE creating variables, not after. The definition must come first.",

    {
        "question": "Which one of the following is an operator specifically used to access structure members through a pointer?",
