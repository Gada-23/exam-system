        "answer": 3,
        "explanation": "Encapsulation in the object-oriented model combines data and methods into a single entity, known as an object. It hides the internal details of the object and provides controlled access to its functionality.",

        ],
        "answer": 2,
        "explanation": "In the object-oriented model, association represents the interactions between objects. It defines the relationships between objects and allows them to communicate and exchange information.",

        ],
        "answer": 1,
        "explanation": "Abstraction in the object-oriented model is used to hide the internal details of an object and provide a simplified interface for interacting with the object. It focuses on the essential features of an object and suppresses unnecessary complexity.",
        "course": "Object Oriented Programming"
    },
    {
        "question": "The concept of polymorphism allows objects to:",

            "Be treated as objects of different classes"
        ],
        "answer": 3,
        "explanation": "Polymorphism in the object-oriented model allows objects to be treated as objects of different classes, as long as they are related through inheritance. It enables flexibility and extensibility in the design and implementation of objects.",

        ],
        "answer": 0,
        "explanation": "In the object-oriented model, a class defines the structure and behavior of objects. It serves as a blueprint for creating objects, specifying their attributes and methods.",
